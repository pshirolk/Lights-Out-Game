# Lights Out Game

This is a C++ graphics program in that allows the user to play the game Lights Out.

It is made in collaboration with my partner Owen Davis from an advanced programming class.

This project was built using Professor Lisa Dion's starter code from a previous graphics project.

### Base Game
In its simplest form, the 5x5 grid of lights begins with all of the lights lit. 
When you click on one of the lights, it toggles itself and the (up to) four lights it borders.


For testing purposes, here are the lights you need to click to get from a fully lit start to a fully unlit end:

| | | |*|*|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|*|*| |*|*|
|*|*|*| | |
| |*|*|*| |
|*| |*|*| |

### Features
* Start screen with the directions written in text
* Keeps track of the number of lights the user clicks and display it on the screen at all times
* Records the amount of time it takes the user to finish the game and print it on the end screen
